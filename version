<1.1>
- Fix issue with picking and prompts for base game and placed plants
- Picking now tracks each plant/prop by its world coordinates, not just by name or config index
- Added support for picking multiple instances of the same base game prop independently
- Improved prompt logic to show at correct locations for all plant types
- Placed props are now frozen and cannot be knocked over
- Improved separation of logic for base game props, placed props, and location-only plants
- Ensured prompts are only shown when player is within correct distance and not already picking
